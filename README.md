# Welcome to my portfolio üíº

This portfolio project is meant to showcase all of my hardwork and progress. With  the programming languages I learn, I apply them into real-world projects that demonstrates my ability to work on real projects that can benefit someone on the other end. The ultimate goal is to provide visitors of my website with an amazing user experience that leaves you wondering "how did he do that!" by the end of your sifting journey of my website.

If you're exploring this repository, it is not by chance. You're either looking for inspiration, or you're looking to hire. I encourage you to ask me questions about how I built this application. I will be more than happy to show you the interworkings behind the reactivity of my app. Below is a breakdown of how I navigated th build process. Whether you choose to continue reading or skip straight to the website, enjoy!

# Project Overview üìΩÔ∏è

This portfolio is being built with HTML, SCSS, JavaScript, JavaScript Object Notation (aka JSON) and MonogoDB. The home page will feature a welcome section that introduces my name and title with animations that brings the text in from the left and right sides of the viewport. The names and title will fade away as you scroll down the webpage. As you continue down the home page, my portfolio projects will fade into view. You will be able to choose which project to view. The snapshots of each project will be featured and clickable. When you click into a project, it will render on a pop-up modal that has an outline that details what the project waas about and when it was built.

As you proceed further, my skills badges will appear. This section will highlight all of the  languages, frameworks, and libraries I have experience using. This leads into my work experience and education. This highlights all relevent experience I have that led me to being an accomplished web developer. 

Feel free to continue to the bottom of the page and click into my social media links to explore further into my world!

By the way, if you're not satisfied with the current theme, just scroll back to the top of the home page and switch between üåí and üåû modes to see what fits best for you.

We're still not finished. The about page will outline my personal life and features a profile picture of me and a short biography about how I found my passion for coding.
