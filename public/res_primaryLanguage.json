      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I'm Kameron Watts, a motivated software developer from Seattle, WA. I discovered my passion for coding in 2019 during a deployment. In my downtime, I would create funny websites for my friends to laugh at. This is before I knew about GitHub, and since then, I have a new laptop. I am currently transitioning from the public safety field into software development. My hobbies are a toss up between cinematic photography and restuarant-hopping. My attention-to-detail, ability to learn quickly, creativity, and ability to problem-solve in a team-oriented environment will catapult me into a successful software development career.",
